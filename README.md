# Description
- Participants are usually given a limited amount of time to answer each question, adding an element of challenge and urgency to the quiz. The time constraint encourages quick thinking and recall, testing how well participants can organize their knowledge within a given timeframe.

# HTML
- Structure and organization: HTML is used to define the structure and layout of webpages by using tags to mark up different elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms. It provides a way to organize content and present it in a logical manner.

# CSS
- CSS is used to separate the content and structure defined in HTML from the visual appearance and design aspects of a webpage. By using CSS, developers can apply styles, such as colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing, to HTML elements, creating a consistent and visually appealing presentation of the content across multiple webpages.

# JavaScript
- JavaScript is a programming language that allows developers to enhance the functionality of HTML documents. It can be used to create interactive features like form validation, animations, dynamic content updates, user interactions, and more. By adding JavaScript to HTML, webpages can respond to user actions, manipulate the content on the page, and communicate with servers, providing a richer and more interactive user experience.
